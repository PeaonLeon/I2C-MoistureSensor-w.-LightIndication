# I2C-MoistureSensor with LightIndication
A Arduino Uno Script for the DFRobot Capacative Moisture sensor (Also selled under different brand names) with Light Indication if a specific value is reached.


# Near Information

• This simple piece of code can be upladed on any Arduino compatible Board with one single Analog Input (ADC for short)

• The different Light Statuses are acomplished with a simple If/Then request

• The Value range can variate per different sensor
( Value can be changed in Void-Loop )

• support for an I2D Display is implemented (can be removed easily)


# Updates will follow in near future.
